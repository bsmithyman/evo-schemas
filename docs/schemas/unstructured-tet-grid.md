# unstructured-tet-grid

<SchemaUri uri="schema/objects/unstructured-tet-grid/1.3.0/unstructured-tet-grid.schema.json" />

Represents an unstructured tetrahedral grid where cells are tetrahedrons.

The grid implements spatial properties including a coordinate reference system and bounding box in world coordinates.

The grid's data are all stored on the `tetrahedra` attribute, which includes the coordinates and connectivity information between them to form tetrahedral cells.
